# Space Minesweeper

- Used TypeScript and Node.js
- Worked with 2D graphics coordinate systems and primitives
- Animated computer graphics based on user input
- Implemented game loops and event handlers

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

## Getting Started

After cloning your repository:

```
npm install
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder in your directory and download all the dependencies needed to run the project.  Note that this folder is `.gitignore` file and should not be committed to your repository.  After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

Webpack should launch your program in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
