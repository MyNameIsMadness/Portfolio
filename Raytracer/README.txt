5607 Assignment 1b

My program is run by inputing "./raytracer [input file name].txt [output file name].ppm".

Warning: Maybe this is just on my end, but if the input file ends in blank lines or if the spacing 
between values is weird, a segfault occurs. This error didn't occur with 1a.

Also the mirroring issue from 1a should be fixed now. 

main is the file that is run.
save and main_old were old copies of main that I held onto for backups.

ray_input_showcase is my showcase input.
